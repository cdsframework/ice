Basic Profile for vMR
---------------------

vMR goals for "Basic" profile:
	Adequately support "Basic vMR" uses including 
		enough demographics to enable the structuring of patient-focused output
		support for basic medical concepts in a wide variety of vocabularies
		support for the expression of all common laboratory results
		support for all common coded observations about a patient
		support for common substance administrations
	Remove elements whose use is primarily for human readability
		this includes simplifying ST datatypes to just the value
	Remove elements whose use is primarily for highly-specialized edge cases
		this includes simplifying CD datatype to omit translations, and changing
		its displayName element to be an attribute of xsd:string

	Extended vMR Profiles are planned for templated extensions to the basic vMR, 
	as required.  Following those general constraints, we have come up with the 
	following list of elements as essential to "Basic" vMR use, expecting them to 
	have broad applicability, even in highly specialized uses of CDS:

Profiling this schema
---------------------

As described in ISO 21090, conformance profiles are able to 
describe subsets of ISO 21090. If a subset schema is derived
from this schema (by, for instance, deleting types, elements or 
attributes, or by tightening schema or schematron constraints),
this heading documentation (copyright statement, this paragraph,
and the version history) must be reproduced as is, along with a
a section above this one explaining who prepared the revised 
schema, what conformance profile it conforms to, and where the 
conformance profile may be found.

AD is primarily used to communicate data that will allow printing mail labels, or that will allow a person to physically visit that address. The postal address datatype is not supposed to be a container for additional information that might be useful for finding geographic locations (e.g., GPS coordinates) or for performing epidemiological studies. Such additional information should be captured by other, more appropriate data structures.

Addresses are essentially sequences of address parts, but add a "use" code and a valid time range for information about if and when the address can be used for a given purpose.

Code SHALL be an exact match to a plain code symbol or expression defined by the code system. If the code system defines a code or expression that includes whitespace, the code SHALL include the whitespace. An expression can only be used where the codeSystem either defines an expression syntax, or there is a generally accepted syntax for the codeSystem. A code system may be defined that only defines an expression syntax with bindings to other code Systems for the elements of the expression. 
It is at the discretion of the interpreting system whether to check for an expression instead of a simple code and evaluate the expression instead of treating the expression as a code. In some cases, it may be unclear or ambiguous whether the code represents a single symbol or an expression. This usually arises where the code system defines an expression language and then defines pre-coordinated concepts with symbols which match their expression, e.g. UCUM. In other cases, it is safe to treat the expression as a symbol. There is no guarantee that this is always safe: the definitions of the codeSystem should always be consulted to determine how to handle potential expressions.

The displayName SHALL conform to any rules defined by the codingSystem; if the codeSystem does not define a human representation for the code or expression, then none can be provided. displayName is included both as a courtesy to an unaided human interpreter of a code value and as a documentation of the name used to display the concept to the user. The display name has no functional meaning; it SHALL never exist without a code; and it SHALL never modify the meaning of the code. A display name may not be present if the code is an expression for which no display name has been assigned or can be derived. Information Processing Entities claiming direct or indirect conformance MAY choose not to implement displayName but SHALL NOT reject instances because displayName is present.
Display names SHALL not alter the meaning of the code value. Therefore, display names SHOULD NOT be presented to the user on a receiving application system without ascertaining that the display name adequately represents the concept referred to by the code value. Communication SHALL NOT simply rely on the display name. The display name's main purpose is to support implementation debugging.

Note: Local implementations may influence what is required to represent that original text.

Original text can be used in a structured user interface to capture what the user saw as a representation of the code on the data input screen, or in a situation where the user dictates or directly enters text, it is the text entered or uttered by the user. 

It is valid to use the CD datatype to store only the text that the user entered or uttered. In this situation, original text will exist without a code. In a situation where the code is assigned sometime after the text was entered, originalText is the text or phrase used as the basis for assigning the code. 

The original text SHALL be an excerpt of the relevant information in the original sources, rather than a pointer or exact reproduction. Thus the original text SHALL be represented in plain text form. In specific circumstances, when clearly descirbed the context of use, the originalText may be a reference to some other text artefact for which the resolution scope is clearly described.

Values of type CD MAY have a original text despite not having a code. Any CD value with no code signifies a coding exception. In this case, originalText is a name or description of the concept that was not coded. </xsd:documentation>

An identifier allows someone to select one record, object or thing from a set of candidates. Usually an identifier alone without any context is not usable. Identifiers are distinguished from concept descriptors as concept descriptors never identify an individual thing, although there may sometimes be an individual record or object that represents the concept.

In the presence of a non-null extension, the root is the unique identifier for the "namespace" of the identifier in the extension. Note that this does NOT necessarily correlate with the organization that manages the issuing of the identifiers. A given organization may manage multiple identifier namespaces, and control over a given namespace may transfer from organization to organization over time while the root remains the same. 
This field can be either a DCE UUID, an Object Identifier (OID), or a special identifier taken from lists that may be published by ISO or HL7. 
Comparison of root values is always case sensitive. UUID's SHALL be represented in upper case, so UUID case should always be preserved.

						<xsd:documentation>A character string as a unique identifier within the scope of the identifier root. 
The root and extension scheme means that the concatenation of root and extension SHALL be a globally unique identifier for the item that this II value identifies.
Some identifier schemes define certain style options to their code values. For example, the U.S. Social Security Number (SSN) is normally written with dashes that group the digits into a pattern "123-12-1234". However, the dashes are not meaningful and a SSN can also be represented as "123121234" without the dashes. In the case where identifier schemes provide for multiple representations, HL7 or ISO may make a ruling about which is the preferred form and document that ruling where that respective external identifier scheme is recognized.
If no extension attribute is provided in a non-null II, then the root is the complete unique identifier.

The RTO datatype supports titers (e.g., 1:128) and other quantities produced by laboratories that truly represent ratios. Ratios are not simply structured numerics, particularly blood pressure measurements (e.g. 120/60) are not ratios.
Notes: 
1.    Ratios are different from rational numbers, i.e., in ratios common factors in the numerator and denominator never cancel out. A ratio of two real or integer numbers is not automatically reduced to a real number. This datatype is not defined to generally represent rational numbers. It is used only if common factors in numerator and denominator are not supposed to cancel out. This is only rarely the case. For observation values, ratios occur almost exclusively with titers. In most other cases, REAL should be used instead of the RTO.</xsd:documentation>

Equality of physical quantities does not require the values and units to be equal independently. Value and unit is only how we represent physical quantities. For example, 1 m equals 100 cm.

Therefore one should never expect a particular unit for a physical quantity but instead allow for automated conversion between different comparable units. 
The unit SHALL come from UCUM, which only specifies unambiguous measurement units. Sometimes it is not clear how some measurements in healthcare map to UCUM codes.
Note: The general pattern for a measurement is  value unit of Thing. In this scheme, the PQ represents the  value and the unit, and the Thing is described by some coded concept that is linked to the PQ by the context of use. This maps obviously to some measurements, such as Patient Body Temperature of 37 Celsius, and 250 mg/day of Salicylate.
However for some measurements that arise in healthcare, the scheme is not so obvious. Two classic examples are 5 Drinks of Beer, and 3 Acetaminophen tablets. At first glance it is tempting to classify these measurements like this: 5 drinks of Beer and 3 Acetaminophen tablets. The problem with this is that UCUM does not support units of "beer", "tablets" or "scoops".
The reason for this is that neither tablets or scoops are proper units. What kind of tablets? How big is the glass? In these kinds of cases, the concept that appears to be a unit needs to further specified before interoperability is established. If a correct amount is required, then it is generally appropriate to specify an exact measurement with an appropriate UCUM unit. If this is not possible, then the concept is not part of the measurement. UCUM provides a unit called unity for use in these cases. The proper way to understand these measurements as 3 1 Acetaminophen tablets, where 1 is the UCUM unit for unity, and the Thing has a qualifier.
