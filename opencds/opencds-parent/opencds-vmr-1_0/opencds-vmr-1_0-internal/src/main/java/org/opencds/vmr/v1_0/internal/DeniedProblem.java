 * An assertion that the subject did not have the problem specified.  For example, if problemCode is diabetes and diagnosticEventTime is 2011-05-01, then an assertion was made on 2011-05-01 that the subject does not have diabetes.

 * To assert that the subject has no known problems, a DeniedProblem can be asserted with a problemCode that is the root-level code for problems or conditions.  E.g., if for a DeniedProblem, problemCode is the root-level code for problems or conditionsand diagnosticEventTime is 2011-05-01, then an assertion was made on 2011-05-01 that the subject has no known problems as of that date.
