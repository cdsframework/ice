Because of the central limit theorem, the normal distribution is the distribution of choice for an unbounded random variable that is an outcome of a combination of many stochastic processes. Even for values bounded on a single side (i.e. greater than 0) the normal distribution may be accurate enough if the mean is "far away" from the bound of the scale measured in terms of standard deviations

Those log-normal parameters µ log and slog relate to the mean µ and standard deviation s of the data value through slog2 = log (s2/µ2 + 1) and µlog = log µ - slog2/2
